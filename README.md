[Spruce](http://spruce.pro) is a general purpose YAML merge tool
with several nifty bells and whistles for making large YAML
configurations easier to manage.  It is primarily used for making
[BOSH](http://bosh.io/) manifests.

[play.spruce.pro](http://play.spruce.pro) is an online playground
for experimenting with different versions of Spruce (including
bleeding edge master builds) without having to install!
